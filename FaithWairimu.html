            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I am priviledged to have attended <strong> Kiamigwi Primary School </strong> for my pre school education.
            I later attended <strong> Kayole 1 Primary school</strong> in Nairobi, Kayole where I performed excellently.<br>
            I then proceeded to <strong> Nyabururu Girl's National School </strong>. That's the school that contributed significantly to the lady I am now. With God's grace I was able to attain a university grade.<br> Currently,I'm a 2nd year student at Maseno University and proudly pursuingthe course of my choice. I was  inspired by one of my lecturers in <strong>Nairobi Institute</strong> where I pursued a certificate in Computer packages.<br>
        Interesting,right? I am sure you agree with me.</p>
